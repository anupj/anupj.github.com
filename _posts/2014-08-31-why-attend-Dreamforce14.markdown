I have never been to Dreamforce and therefore I am quite excited to attend DF14 this year at San Fransisco.
Since I don't have first hand experience of attending Dreamforce I have selected a list of blog posts from MVPs
and rockstars from the Salesforce community who have written about why you should attend Dreamforce. 

* Bob Buzzard (@Bob_Buzzard) - [Why you have to attend Dreamforce](http://bobbuzzard.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/why-you-have-to-attend-dreamforce.html)

* Kartik Visanadha (@logontokartik) [Why should a Developer Attend Dreamforce?](http://salesforcetech.wordpress.com/2014/08/12/why-should-a-developer-attend-dreamforce-developers-point-of-view/)

* Shivanath Devinarayanan (@ShivanathD) [TOP REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD ATTEND DREAMFORCE] (http://blog.shivanathd.com/2014/08/Why-Attend-Dreamforce.html)

* Matt Lacey (@laceysnr) [The Benefits of Sending Your Developers to Dreamforce](http://www.laceysnr.com/2014/08/the-benefits-of-sending-your-developers.html)

* Simon Lawrence (@srlawr) [Why you should absolutely let your employees attend Dreamforce] (http://srlawr.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/why-you-should-absolutely-let-your.html)

This is by no means an exhaustive list but if you read these posts you will get a fairly good idea of why you should attend Dreamforce this year.
See you at Dreamforce! :-)
